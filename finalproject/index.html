            <h2>About Gautam Buddha</h2>
            <p>Gautam Buddha, also known as Siddhartha Gautama, was a spiritual teacher who lived in ancient India. He is the founder of Buddhism, one of the world's major religions.</p>
            <p>Buddha was born in Lumbini, in present-day Nepal, around the 6th century BCE. He renounced his princely life and embarked on a spiritual quest to understand the nature of suffering and find enlightenment.</p>
            <p>After years of meditation and contemplation, Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India. He spent the rest of his life teaching the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path to liberation.</p>
