			<h2>Soccer</h2>
			<p>I love soccer because it is a beautiful and exciting sport. It is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels, and it is a sport that is played all over the world. I have been playing soccer all my life and when I get on the field I forget every other thing. Not only do I love playing but I also love watching the game. The team that I support is Manchester City. It's English club. I love all the player from Manchester City.</p>
